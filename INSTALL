INSTALL
=======

Modify the Makefile to fit your system, especially the path to the Asterisk 
include files.

To build the driver you will need an installed capi system, including header 
files.

To build the channel driver:
---------------------------------
make

To install:
----------------
make install

To install a sample configuration:
----------------------------------
make install_config


In /etc/asterisk/modules.conf insert the line:
    load => chan_capi.so

    and in the [global] section:
    chan_capi.so=yes

HEY, don't forget a trailing newline at the end of modules.conf!!!
