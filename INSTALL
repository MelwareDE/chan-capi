Modify the Makefile to fit your system, especially the path to the Asterisk include files.

Currently there are some buildtime configuration parameters. You can enable early B3 connects
if you want the capi channels to come up very soon and hear the indications from your
local exchange (native capi indications).
You can also force software dtmf detection/generation to be used.

To build the driver you will need an installed capi system, including header files.

to build the channel driver type:
make

to install:
make install

to install a sample configuration:
make config


in /etc/asterisk/modules.conf insert the line:
    load => chan_capi.so

    and in the [global] section:
    chan_capi.so=yes


HEY, dont forget a trailing newline at the end of modules.conf!!!
