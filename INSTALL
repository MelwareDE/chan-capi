Modify the Makefile to fit your system, especially the path to the Asterisk 
include files.

Currently there are some buildtime configuration parameters:
- You can switch to Ulaw. 

To build the driver you will need an installed capi system, including header 
files.

To build the channel driver type:
---------------------------------
make

To install type:
----------------
make install

To install a sample configuration:
----------------------------------
make config


In /etc/asterisk/modules.conf insert the line:
    load => chan_capi.so

    and in the [global] section:
    chan_capi.so=yes

HEY, don't forget a trailing newline at the end of modules.conf!!!
