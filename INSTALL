INSTALL
=======

Modify the Makefile to fit your system, especially the path to the Asterisk 
include files.

To build the driver you will need an installed CAPI system, including header 
files.

To build the channel module:
---------------------------------
make

For verbose compiling:
---------------------------------
make V=1


To install:
----------------
make install


To install a sample configuration:
----------------------------------
make install_config


In /etc/asterisk/modules.conf insert the line:
    load => chan_capi.so

    and in the [global] section:
    chan_capi.so=yes

Don't forget a trailing newline at the end of modules.conf!
